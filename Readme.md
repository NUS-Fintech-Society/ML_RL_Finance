# Reinforcement Learning to make better trading decisions

## Description
 Diversifying one's trading portfolio is recommended to lower risk and yield returns from a variety of investments. However, it is impossible for one to monitor every single investment within the portfolio 24/7, so the use of technology can help portfolio managers in this aspect. We aim to use Reinforcement Learning to enhance the trading decisions of portfolio managers and financial planners by maximising profits earned from a diverse portfolio.

 ## Dependencies
 Our program uses [OpenAI-Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) to create environments and develop our algorithms. Specifically, we use [gym-anytrading](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading) to create abstract environments that we can extend to develop our own environments that support a basket of investments.
